<h1>Digital Prototypes</h1>

<br><br>


<h2>Information</h2>


<p>The two prototypes I have created offer very different functions through their design. The first prototype named 'Kungfuforeveryone', is a Wordpress blogging site which is designed to offer general information on the Martial Art of Kung Fu. This Wordpress website was created using initial sketches, wireframes and Information Architecture methodologies. During the development process, I used UX design techniques in order to establish a UCD guidance protocol. The use of a UCD approach allowed for user testing input and user centred feedback, which I utilised during the creation of this Wordpress site.
<br></br>

The second of the these prototypes I have developed is a Rich Internet Application, which is a desktop programme translated and built for the web. I used the Adobe Edge Animate web development tool to structure and build an application which I hoped would pay homage to the late great Bruce Lee. This RIA was also designed and built around UX design best practices, which certainly help with features such as, the positioning of content, colour scheme and responsive nature of the applications elements.
<br></br>

As you will undoubtedly notice, my prototypes both share the same theme, that of Martial Arts. I had chosen to use this specific stylised content as I feel that Martial Arts could play an effective role in most young peoples lives, as it has a power to guide and secure a persons life in so many ways. Promoting the 'Martial Way' (as Bruce Lee termed it), through creative online content is one of my goals in creating these prototypes. I have, to a certain level achieved this goal, with these two projects. 
<br></br>

More recently, I have developed a Ruby on Rails prototype application, which is also designed using a Martial Arts theme. This application however, delivers a different service as with OO programming there is the ability to integrate an authentication process and build a database of information which has been generated by users input.</p>
